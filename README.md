# KBSpline

This is a Kochanek-Bartels spline class written to operate within the unit interval. This means that onscreen coordinates and measurements must be multiplied by the values returned by this class.

I have plans of converting this over fully to ES6+ syntax, as well as expanding this into the arbitrary interval.

My most ambitious goal for this project is to create a 3-dimensional variation with the possibility of incorporating must faster matrix math.
